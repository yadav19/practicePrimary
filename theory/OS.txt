Operatng Systems:
    > OS is an interface between user and hardware

    ->System Call:
        whenever we require any system resource. we call upon the OS for that resource.
        printf is done by write system call on the console.
    
    Goals:
        > Convenience: so that we dont have to write system call every time we use some resource
                        but we make it easy by packing it up into one system call by the OS.
        > Efficiency: best way for a system call is already implemented into the OS.

Two types of Processing:
1. CPU
2. IO

Types:
> Batch OS:
    single computer was available and users code will be executed in queue.
    people used to collect results after sometime.
    CONS:
        >if a preceeding job will take many days then 
         all succeeding jobs will be stopped, irrespective of their time being just 1s.
        > CPU can be idle.
> Multiprogramming:
    > CPU can never be idle.
> Multitasking
    > every task/job are given set time opportunity and
    their intermideate results are stored.
> multiprocessing:
    > many cpu in one computer.
> Realtime:
    > jobs with deadline
