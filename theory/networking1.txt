OSI(open system interconnection):
When two application/services try to communicate remotely from different host, 
they follow set of rules which is OSI model.
simply, OSI model is the basic network architecture for communication.
It is divided into 7 parts:
1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transmission Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Application Layer
7. Presentation Layer

1. Physical Layer:
    This deals with all the physical aspects of the network architecture.
    this include:
    i. Physical Hardwares: network card, wires, router, etc.
    ii. Encoding/Decoding: Digital data to Analog Signals and Analog signals to digital data.
    iii. Transmission/ Reception: It also deals with transmittion these Analog signals, as well as recieving them.
    iv. Network Topology:
        It means how the different servers/nodes are connected to each other which in itself forms the network,
        and thereby, communication happens.
        different types of network Topologies are:

        a. Bus Topology : 
            All servers/nodes are connected to a single channel.
            Disadvantages: 
            > very hard to detect errors.
            > very limited speed due to single main channel.
            Advantages:
            > broadcasting is easy.
        
        b. Star Topology:
            All servers/nodes are connected to a centralised hub.
            Advantages:
            > Easy for error detection.
            > most optimum speed.
            > easy communication between nodes.
            Disadvantages:
            > once the centralised hub crashes, the whole network shuts down.
        
        c. Mesh Topology:
            servers are connected to many other servers but not all of them.
            Advantages: 
            >broadcasting is easy.
            Disadvantages:
            > expensive.
            > error detection is hard.
        
        d. Ring/Circle Topology
            one server is connect to two other servers thus forming a circle/ring structure.
            Advantages:
            > Broadcasting is easy.
            > error detection is easy.
            Disadvantages:
            > once one server goes down all goes to hell.

2. Data Link Layer:
    This layer acts like a brain to the body that is the Network Layer.
    works in this layer includes:
    i. Framing
    ii. Sequence Numbering
    iii. Acknowledgement
    iv. Error detection
    v. Retransmission
    vi. Flow Control

3. Network Layer:
    Deals with routing data packets from source to the destination.
    1. Routing
    2. Congestion
    3. InterNetworking

4. Transport Layer:
    desls with:
    i. Multiplexing/Demultiplexing
    ii. Fragmentation/Assembly
    iii. Mode of Transmission
    iv. Flow Control
    v. Error detection

5. Session Layer
6. Application Layer
7. Presentation Layer
